# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-07)

**Core value:** A researcher types a task prompt and watches SOARM execute it in a LIBERO simulation — the loop from language to embodied action.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — colab-environment-setup

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (colab-environment-setup) — EXECUTING
Plan: 1 of 4
Status: Executing Phase 01
Last activity: 2026-07-09 — Phase 01 execution started

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] 17% (all Phase 01 plans complete)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 0
- Average duration: -
- Total execution time: 0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| - | - | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: none
- Trend: -

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Research: OpenVLA-OFT chosen as primary VLA (97.1% LIBERO avg, T4-compatible at 4-bit)
- Research: SOARM MJCF to be derived from `so101_new_calib.xml`, not built from scratch
- Research: Two separate Colab kernel groups needed (transformers version conflict between LIBERO training and VLA inference)
- Research: Demo replay must be state-based (not action replay) — LIBERO issue #16
- 01-02: numba 0.59.x chosen for numpy 1.x compat — Colab system numba compiled for numpy 2.x causes ABI crash after our numpy<2 pin
- 01-02: ENV-01 pip check filtered to OUR_PACKAGES — Colab system conflicts (jax/cupy/opencv needing numpy>=2) are pre-existing noise
- 01-02: torch version comparison strips build tag — "2.2.0+cu121".split('+')[0] == "2.2.0"
- 01-03: prismatic package must come from moojink/openvla-oft repo (--no-deps) — TRI-ML prismatic-vlms lacks prismatic.training; nothing usable on PyPI
- 01-03 (resolves RESEARCH A1, CONFIRMED on Colab): OFT checkpoint norm_stats = OXE pretraining datasets only; LIBERO stats must be overlaid from dataset_statistics.json (hf_hub_download) after from_pretrained; actual key is "libero_spatial_no_noops" — Phase 3 inference loop MUST replicate this
- 01-03 (CONFIRMED on Colab): OFT predict_action returns (actions, hidden_states) tuple with action chunk shape (8, 7) float64 — Phase 3 must unpack and consume 8-step chunks, not single steps
- 01-03: prismatic import chain needs wandb (metrics.py) — included in Step 5 since openvla-oft installs with --no-deps

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 2 research flag: SOARM robosuite 1.4 ManipulatorModel integration is novel — budget 1-2 days of iterative MJCF editing; reference TechLabs Aachen SO100+robosuite as prior art
- Phase 5 research flag: Spatial VLA input representation (multi-camera RGB vs RGB+depth vs auxiliary 3D annotations) is an open question — study SpatialVLA, VEGA, cVLA before committing

## Deferred Items
